# model-detections-to-PASCAL-VOC
This project helps to semi-automate the labelling process for object detection model by converting the raw detections made by the pre-trained object detection model to xml files in PASCAL VOC format. The xml files and the images can the be loaded into an annotation tool. The user then has to just tweak the bounding boxes and save making the process easier.
